# About:

  This is documentation for my plant monitor project. In this repository, you should be able to find:
  My code, part list and a circuit diagram
  This project was inspired by my interest in plants and growing my own food.

# Introduction:

  In this projct I wanted to use sensors and an arduino to help monitor the enviroument where my plant lives.
  I used:
  - a soil moisture sensor from sparkfun
  - a DHT humidity and temperature sensor from elegoo superstarter kit
  - a photocell from elegoo superstarter kit
  - a 10k potentiometer from elegoo superstarter kit
  - a 2x16 LCD display from elegoo superstarter kit
  - a microcontroller (arduino) from elegoo superstarter kit
  - a bread board from elegoo superstarter kit
  - Wires from elegoo superstarter kit
  I specified where I got my parts, but of course you could find similar parts from sparkfun or adafruit.
  Don't be afraid to google.

  Here are the resorces I used when I was building this project, I hope it offers a better understanding of how I put
  everything together. But if you are impatient and just want to build it, jump straight to my circuit diagram and 
  code I wrote.
