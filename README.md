# About:

  This is documentation for my plant monitor project. In this repository, you should be able to find:
  - My code, under "plant_monitor_.ino"
  - Part list and a circuit diagram 
  This project was inspired by my interest in plants and growing my own food.

# Introduction:

  In this projct I wanted to use sensors and an arduino to help monitor the enviroument where my plant lives.
  I used:
  - a soil moisture sensor from sparkfun
  - a DHT humidity and temperature sensor from elegoo superstarter kit
  - a photocell from elegoo superstarter kit
  - a 10k potentiometer from elegoo superstarter kit
  - a 2x16 LCD display from elegoo superstarter kit
  - a microcontroller (arduino) from elegoo superstarter kit
  - a bread board from elegoo superstarter kit
  - Wires from elegoo superstarter kit
  I specified where I got my parts, but of course you could find similar parts from sparkfun or adafruit.
  Don't be afraid to google.

  Here are the resorces I used when I was building this project, I hope it offers a better understanding of how I put
  everything together. But if you are impatient and just want to build it, jump straight to my circuit diagram and 
  code I wrote.

# What I Would Change:
  While the display is nice and informative, if I were to build it again I would make it more interesting, for example,
  make the plant monitor scream. (haha) Or transfer the data wirelessly and plot the conditons to better analyze the 
  conditions the plant/garden is in. Also as you can see, the wiring is a mess! That's gotta be better. Another thing is
  that, it would be good to consider putting the arduino to sleep while not in use to conserve energy. One more thing! 
  It would be would be great to conect it to a solar pannel to make it completly self-suffcient.
